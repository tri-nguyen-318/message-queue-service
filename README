This repo is used to define simple message queues

# Basic usage

# Example 1: Simple message queue

We will focus on two files `producer.js` and `consumer.js`.

Open a terminal to run producer

```
node producer <optional message>
```

Open one or more than one terminal to run consumers to listen to the message from the queue

```
node comsumer
```

# Example 2: Pub sub model with exchange

In this example, we'll focus on files inside `pubsub` folder

Change dir to pubsub folder when you open a new terminal

```
cd pubsub
```

Open a terminal to run producer

```
node post <optional message>
```

Open one or more than one terminal to run consumers to listen to the message from the queue

```
node comsumer
```

# Example 3: Pubsub model with topic

In this example, we'll focus on files inside `topic` folder

```
cd topic
```
